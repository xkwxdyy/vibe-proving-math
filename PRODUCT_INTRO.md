# Product Overview

`vibe_proving` is an AI-powered mathematical research assistant designed for students and researchers. The platform integrates language models with theorem retrieval to support interactive workflows across learning, problem-solving, proof review, and knowledge discovery.

## Design Philosophy

Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, vibe_proving prioritizes mathematical correctness through external verification:

1. **Citation Verification** — Language model outputs are cross-checked against theorem databases
2. **Independent Validation** — Proof steps are verified without access to generator reasoning
3. **Counterexample Generation** — Active falsification attempts before accepting claims
4. **Confidence Reporting** — Transparent uncertainty assessment with explicit confidence scores
5. **Theorem Retrieval** — Semantic search across 9M+ indexed theorems from mathematical literature

This architecture reduces hallucination risk in mathematical contexts where accuracy is non-negotiable.

## Core Capabilities

### Learning Mode

Generates structured mathematical explanations:
- **Prerequisites**: Background definitions and required theorems
- **Proof Walkthrough**: Step-by-step reasoning with annotations
- **Examples**: Concrete instances and counterexamples
- **Extensions**: Related results and generalizations

Target difficulty levels: undergraduate or graduate.

### Solving Mode

Proof generation pipeline with quality control:
1. **Direct Retrieval**: Check if problem already solved in theorem databases
2. **Proof Generation**: Create initial draft with reasoning steps
3. **Independent Verification**: Validate logic without generator bias
4. **Citation Checking**: Verify theorem references via TheoremSearch
5. **Counterexample Testing**: Attempt to falsify claims before accepting
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent assessment with explicit uncertainty

Output includes structured proof, verified citations, failed paths, and reasoning obstacles.

### Review Mode

Structured analysis of mathematical writing:
- **Logic Consistency**: Detect missing steps, circular reasoning, unjustified leaps
- **Citation Accuracy**: Verify referenced theorems exist and are correctly stated
- **Symbol Consistency**: Track variable scope and assumption dependencies

Supported formats: text, LaTeX, images (via vision models), PDF (via OCR).

### Search Mode

Semantic theorem retrieval:
- 9M+ theorems indexed from arXiv, Stacks Project, and specialized databases
- Natural language queries without formula syntax requirements
- Similarity scoring and ranking
- Direct links to original papers

### Quality Control Mechanisms

1. **External Citation Database**: TheoremSearch API prevents hallucinated references
2. **Independent Verification**: Proof validator operates without generator context
3. **Counterexample Engine**: Active falsification before claiming truth
4. **LaTeX Sanitization**: Automatic cleaning for frontend rendering
5. **Confidence Thresholds**: System refuses to answer when uncertain

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Server-Sent Events for progressive streaming
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no build toolchain)
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI-compatible interface (model-agnostic)
- **Theorem Database**: TheoremSearch API
- **PDF Processing**: Nanonets OCR for formula-preserving extraction
- **Formal Verification** (Beta): Harmonic Aristotle for Lean 4

## Deployment

Configuration via `config.toml`:

```toml
[llm]
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
api_key = "your-key"
model = "deepseek-chat"

[theorem_search]
base_url = "https://api.theoremsearch.com"

[nanonets]
api_key = "your-key"  # Optional, for PDF review
```

Minimum requirement: LLM API key. Optional services enhance functionality but are not required for core operations.

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests -m "not slow"  # Fast regression
pytest tests                # Full suite (requires API keys)
```

Coverage includes configuration, LLM integration, all operational modes, citation verification, LaTeX sanitization, and error handling.

## Current Status

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Learning | Stable | Streaming explanations with memory integration |
| Solving | Stable | GVR pipeline with citation checking |
| Review | Stable | Quality depends on OCR backend |
| Search | Stable | Direct TheoremSearch integration |
| Formalization | Beta | Lean 4 translation for research users |

## Design Constraints

1. **Verification Over Trust**: Never accept model outputs without external checks when verification is available
2. **Transparency**: Return confidence scores and failed paths, not just final answers
3. **Academic Rigor**: Optimize for correctness over speed
4. **Local-First**: Minimize cloud dependencies where feasible
5. **Open Integration**: Standard interfaces (OpenAI API, REST) over proprietary formats

## Comparison

**vs. General LLM Chatbots**: Adds citation checking, proof verification, and structured workflows

**vs. Wolfram Alpha**: Handles abstract proofs beyond symbolic computation

**vs. arXiv**: Offers semantic search and structured proof analysis

**vs. Lean Prover**: Provides natural language interface without formal syntax requirements

## Future Development

- Expand theorem database coverage
- Improve PDF parsing reliability
- Add collaborative features (team projects, shared knowledge bases)
- Support for additional proof assistants
